# Overview

I'm a PhD candidate at Harvard Business School conducting research at the intersection of innovation strategy, organization theory, and entrepreneurship. I'm on the job market this year (2022-2023). My dissertation committee is Rory McDonald, Raj Choudhury, and Gary Pisano.

In my <a href="https://ryantallen.com/research/#dissertation-working-papers" target="_blank">dissertation research</a> I ask: how do organizations anticipate market demand to produce commercially successful innovations? Whereas prior work extols the benefits of analytics and experimentation, I identify circumstances in which these methods can be misleading. Click the dropdown for more details:

<ul>
<li>In <strong>chapter 1</strong> of my dissertation, I show that when incumbent products enjoy high market power, new products that initially appeal to niche market segments are more likely to achieve widespread commercial success than products that initially enjoy broad appeal. Therefore, prior to launch, innovations with the most potential for commercial success may systematically appear to have small potential market sizes according to traditional quantitative market-sizing techniques.</li>
  
<li>In <strong>chapter 2 (my job market paper)</strong>, I ask whether organizations with data-driven cultures are more innovative. This question has evoked polarized viewpoints: some argue that reliance on quantitative data increases innovative foresight by reducing the biases inherent in softer methods, whereas others argue that such reliance leads to merely incremental innovation. Instead of focusing on the magnitude of reliance on quantitative analysis, I focus on what I call the <i>epistemic plasticity</i> of organizational culture—the extent to which the culture values different kinds of analyses. Surprisingly, I show that data-driven organizations produce the most breakthrough commercial successes—but only if they also liberally use qualitative analysis.</li>
  
<li>In <strong>chapter 3</strong>, I study experimentation-driven product innovation in user communities. I show that innovation trajectories can get derailed when innovators are highly responsive to experimentation in highly concentrated user communities that are not representative of the broader market.</li>

Prior to doctoral studies at HBS, I studied Economics at BYU, served a 2-year mission in Taiwan for my church, conducted economic research on environmental health issues, managed at a nonprofit, and did a stint as data analyst at Amazon. 

As a Utah native, I like hiking, mountain biking, and skiing. I also enjoy reading sci-fi books and technology blogs. I thrive when I'm learning new skills (e.g., guitar, coding, fixing things). I'm having fun helping my wife build an e-commerce business. We live in Cambridge, MA with our 3 children.
