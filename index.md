# Overview

I am a PhD candidate at Harvard Business School. I conduct research at the intersection of strategy, organization theory, and entrepreneurship. I am on the job market this year, 2022-2023.

[My dissertation research](./research.md#working-papers) is organized around the question: how can innovators anticipate market demand to create commercially successful innovations? I demonstrate that prior work, which tends to extol the benefits of predictive analytics and experimentation, is incomplete.

<ul>
<li>In <strong>chapter 1</strong> of my dissertation, I show that when incumbent products enjoy high market power, new products that initially appeal to niche market segments are more likely to achieve widespread commercial success than products that initially enjoy broad appeal. Therefore, prior to launch, innovations with the most potential for commercial success may systematically appear to have small potential market sizes according to traditional quantitative market-sizing techniques.</li>
  
<li>In <strong>chapter 2 (my job market paper)</strong>, I ask whether organizations with data-driven cultures are more innovative. This question has evoked polarized viewpoints: some argue that reliance on quantitative data increases innovative foresight by reducing the biases inherent in softer methods, whereas others argue that such reliance leads to merely incremental innovation. Instead of focusing on the magnitude of reliance on quantitative analysis, I focus on what I call the *epistemic plasticity* of organizational culture—the extent to which the culture values different kinds of analyses. Surprisingly, I show that data-driven organizations produce the most breakthrough commercial successes—but only if they also liberally use qualitative analysis.</li>
  
<li>In <strong>chapter 3</strong>, I study experimentation-driven product innovation in user communities. I show that innovation trajectories can get derailed when innovators are highly responsive to experimentation in highly concentrated user communities that are not representative of the broader market.</li>
</ul>

My dissertation work builds on my [prior publications](./research.md#publications) on [algorithms+judgment](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2021.1554), [epistomology in machine learning methods](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smj.3215), and [industry dynamics](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/stsc.2021.0130).

Prior to HBS I studied Economics/Math/Strategy at BYU, served a 2-year mission for my church in Taiwan, conducted economic research on environmental health issues, managed at a nonprofit, and worked as data analyst at Amazon. Outside school, my wife and I are slowly building an [e-commerce empire](https://www.myrosalyn.com/). I life in Cambridge, MA with my wife and 3 children.
