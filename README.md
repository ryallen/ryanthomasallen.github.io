# Overview

I am a PhD candidate at Harvard Business School. I conduct research at the intersection of strategy, organization theory, and entrepreneurship.

My current work is organized around the question: how can innovators anticipate market demand to create commercially successful innovations? I demonstrate that prior work extolling the benefits of predictive analytics and experimentation is incomplete.

In chapter 1 of my dissertation, I show that when incumbent products enjoy high market power, new products that initially appeal to niche market segments are more likely to achieve widespread commercial success than products that initially enjoy broad appeal. Therefore, prior to launch, innovations with the most potential for commercial success may systematically appear to have small potential market sizes according to traditional quantitative market-sizing techniques. 

In chapter 2 (my job market paper), I ask whether organizations with data-driven cultures are more innovative. This question has evoked polarized viewpoints: some argue that reliance on quantitative data increases innovative foresight by reducing the biases inherent in softer methods, whereas others argue that such reliance leads to merely incremental innovation. Instead of focusing on the magnitude of reliance on quantitative analysis, I focus on what I call the *epistemic plasticity* of organizational culture—the extent to which the culture values different kinds of analyses. Surprisingly, I show that data-driven organizations produce the most breakthrough commercial successes—but only if they also liberally use qualitative analysis.

In chapter 3, I study experimentation-driven product innovation in user communities. I show that innovation trajectories can get derailed when innovators are highly responsive to experimentation in highly concentrated user communities that are not representative of the broader market.

The chapters of my dissertation are informed by my prior published papers on algorithms+judgment, machine learning epistomology, and industry dynamics.

Prior to HBS I studied Economics/Math/Strategy at BYU, served a 2-year mission for my church in Taiwan, conducted economic research on environmental health issues, managed at a nonprofit, and worked as data analyst at Amazon. Outside school, my wife and I are slowly building an [e-commerce empire](https://www.myrosalyn.com/). I life in Cambridge, MA with my wife and 3 children.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
A long tradition in strategy and innovation research asserts that data-driven organizations—whose new-product investment decisions are based on quantitative evidence of market demand—excel at incremental innovation, but unintentionally allocate resources away from less-measurable breakthrough innovations. Questioning this reasoning, I distinguish the magnitude of an organization’s use of quantitative analysis from the epistemic plasticity of its organizational culture (the extent to which it uses non-quantitative analyses). Specifically, I argue and demonstrate that organizations that make substantial use of quantitative analysis will produce more breakthrough innovations—provided that their cultures are plastic enough to use qualitative analysis liberally as well. To test my theory, I measure innovation performance using product-level sales and attribute data for over 3,500 consumer product launches from 61 firms between 2010 and 2016; I measure each organization’s use of qualitative and quantitative analyses by applying a word embedding algorithm to employee résumé job descriptions. I demonstrate that increased reliance on quantitative analysis decreases innovation performance when qualitative analysis is low, and, conversely, increases innovation when qualitative analysis is high. Particularly when launching novel products, epistemic plasticity precipitates both more breakthrough successes and, surprisingly, fewer flops. I also explore the antecedents of organizations’ plasticity and of dogma, and demonstrate the boundary conditions of market uncertainty and methodological polarization between individuals. This paper contributes to organizational theories of innovation, decision-making, and the link between organizational culture and strategic performance.</details>

**"If We Build It, Will They Come? The Market Size Paradox of Niche Product Innovations"**
<ul>
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
Are relatively niche product innovations—innovations that initially appeal to relatively narrow market segments—more likely to achieve commercial success?  Despite a great deal of academic and practitioner interest in the question, there is very little systematic evidence of the link between niche market entry and commercial performance of innovations from a demand-side perspective. Drawing from research on strategy and innovation diffusion, I hypothesize that niche market entry will positively impact a new innovation’s commercial performance, but only when when a high proportion of initial customers are “tastemaker” early adopters, and when market incumbents enjoy high market power. Tests on an archival dataset of over 11,000 product innovations in the CPG sector from 2006-2019 support my hypotheses. These findings contribute theoretically to research on strategy and innovation diffusion, and imply a “market size paradox”: innovations that initially appeal to relatively narrow market niches (as opposed to broad appeal) tend to achieve greater commercial success. Thus prior to launch, many innovations with the most potential for commercial success may systematically appear to have small potential market sizes according to many traditional market-sizing techniques.

**"Experimentation-driven Product Innovation in User-Communities: The Engagement Dilemma"** with Rory McDonald and Rob Bremner
<ul>
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
 This study investigates experimentation-driven product innovation in user communities. Prior research has largely focused on the innovation benefits of leveraging users and user communities as an experimentation resource. In this paper, we posit that reaping the innovation-related benefits of experimentation is contingent upon the degree to which the community provides an unbiased representation of the broader market. Using longitudinal and interview data on experimental PC game development, we find that adapting games in response to community feedback increases games’ commercial performance on average, unless the game’s user community is concentrated in a narrow market segment. Such narrowly concentrated niche communities give signals of market demand that, when incorporated into the game, can decrease the game’s appeal to broader audiences. However, responding to the feedback from such concentrated communities is necessary to maintain and grow the user community. Jointly, our theory and results suggest that firms involved in experimentation-driven product innovation with user communities face an engagement dilemma: incorporating feedback from engaged niche communities has the potential to mislead innovation efforts, but ignoring that feedback may stunt the development of the community resource.
