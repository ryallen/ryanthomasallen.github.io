<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
A long tradition in strategy and innovation research asserts that data-driven organizations—whose new-product investment decisions are based on quantitative evidence of market demand—excel at incremental innovation, but unintentionally allocate resources away from less-measurable breakthrough innovations. Questioning this reasoning, I distinguish the magnitude of an organization’s use of quantitative analysis from the epistemic plasticity of its organizational culture (the extent to which it uses non-quantitative analyses). Specifically, I argue and demonstrate that organizations that make substantial use of quantitative analysis will produce more breakthrough innovations—provided that their cultures are plastic enough to use qualitative analysis liberally as well. To test my theory, I measure innovation performance using product-level sales and attribute data for over 3,500 consumer product launches from 61 firms between 2010 and 2016; I measure each organization’s use of qualitative and quantitative analyses by applying a word embedding algorithm to employee résumé job descriptions. I demonstrate that increased reliance on quantitative analysis decreases innovation performance when qualitative analysis is low, and, conversely, increases innovation when qualitative analysis is high. Particularly when launching novel products, epistemic plasticity precipitates both more breakthrough successes and, surprisingly, fewer flops. I also explore the antecedents of organizations’ plasticity and of dogma, and demonstrate the boundary conditions of market uncertainty and methodological polarization between individuals. This paper contributes to organizational theories of innovation, decision-making, and the link between organizational culture and strategic performance.</details>

**"If We Build It, Will They Come? The Market Size Paradox of Niche Product Innovations"**
<ul>
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
Are relatively niche product innovations—innovations that initially appeal to relatively narrow market segments—more likely to achieve commercial success?  Despite a great deal of academic and practitioner interest in the question, there is very little systematic evidence of the link between niche market entry and commercial performance of innovations from a demand-side perspective. Drawing from research on strategy and innovation diffusion, I hypothesize that niche market entry will positively impact a new innovation’s commercial performance, but only when when a high proportion of initial customers are “tastemaker” early adopters, and when market incumbents enjoy high market power. Tests on an archival dataset of over 11,000 product innovations in the CPG sector from 2006-2019 support my hypotheses. These findings contribute theoretically to research on strategy and innovation diffusion, and imply a “market size paradox”: innovations that initially appeal to relatively narrow market niches (as opposed to broad appeal) tend to achieve greater commercial success. Thus prior to launch, many innovations with the most potential for commercial success may systematically appear to have small potential market sizes according to many traditional market-sizing techniques.

**"Experimentation-driven Product Innovation in User-Communities: The Engagement Dilemma"** with Rory McDonald and Rob Bremner
<ul>
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
 This study investigates experimentation-driven product innovation in user communities. Prior research has largely focused on the innovation benefits of leveraging users and user communities as an experimentation resource. In this paper, we posit that reaping the innovation-related benefits of experimentation is contingent upon the degree to which the community provides an unbiased representation of the broader market. Using longitudinal and interview data on experimental PC game development, we find that adapting games in response to community feedback increases games’ commercial performance on average, unless the game’s user community is concentrated in a narrow market segment. Such narrowly concentrated niche communities give signals of market demand that, when incorporated into the game, can decrease the game’s appeal to broader audiences. However, responding to the feedback from such concentrated communities is necessary to maintain and grow the user community. Jointly, our theory and results suggest that firms involved in experimentation-driven product innovation with user communities face an engagement dilemma: incorporating feedback from engaged niche communities has the potential to mislead innovation efforts, but ignoring that feedback may stunt the development of the community resource.
