"Epistemic Plasticity and Innovation in Data-Driven Organizational Cultures" (Job Market Paper)

<summary>Abstract</summary>
<br>
A long tradition in strategy and innovation research asserts that data-driven organizations—whose new-product investment decisions are based on quantitative evidence of market demand—excel at incremental innovation, but unintentionally allocate resources away from less-measurable breakthrough innovations. Questioning this reasoning, I distinguish the magnitude of an organization’s use of quantitative analysis from the epistemic plasticity of its organizational culture (the extent to which it uses non-quantitative analyses). Specifically, I argue and demonstrate that organizations that make substantial use of quantitative analysis will produce more breakthrough innovations—provided that their cultures are plastic enough to use qualitative analysis liberally as well. To test my theory, I measure innovation performance using product-level sales and attribute data for over 3,500 consumer product launches from 61 firms between 2010 and 2016; I measure each organization’s use of qualitative and quantitative analyses by applying a word embedding algorithm to employee résumé job descriptions. I demonstrate that increased reliance on quantitative analysis decreases innovation performance when qualitative analysis is low, and, conversely, increases innovation when qualitative analysis is high. Particularly when launching novel products, epistemic plasticity precipitates both more breakthrough successes and, surprisingly, fewer flops. I also explore the antecedents of organizations’ plasticity and of dogma, and demonstrate the boundary conditions of market uncertainty and methodological polarization between individuals. This paper contributes to organizational theories of innovation, decision-making, and the link between organizational culture and strategic performance.
