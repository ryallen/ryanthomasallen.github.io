This is the repository for my professional online CV website, hosted through Github Pages

I still need to add:
- (TEACHING PAGE) A description of my teaching interests and philosophy
- (RESEARCH PAGE) Other research and Taobao case (or maybe on teaching page?)
- (RESEARCH PAGE) Where I've submitted each working paper
- (RESEARCH PAGE) abstract for paper with Aticus
